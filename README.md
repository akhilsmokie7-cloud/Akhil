Here’s a robust **multi-service repository template** you can use for a codebase that includes several services (e.g., microservices, modular apps, or backend/frontend/API combos). This template is suitable for projects that wish to scale, collaborate, and maintain clarity—perfect for modern workflows and can be aligned with your "ancient energy shifting" and "Golden Era" themes by adding relevant docs or naming conventions.

## Explanation

- **services/**:  
  Each subfolder is an independent service (API, worker, frontend, etc.), with its own code, dependencies, and tests.

- **shared/**:  
  Libraries/utilities shared among services (for DRY code).

- **deploy/**:  
  Deployment configuration (Docker Compose, Kubernetes manifests, etc.).

- **docs/**:  
  Project documentation. You can highlight your unique energy themes here.

- **.github/**:  
  GitHub-specific files: workflows (CI/CD), templates, etc.

- **README.md / LICENSE**:  
  Project overview and licensing.

## Customization for Your Theme

You can add “energy-shifting” principles in docs, naming, or even as service names (e.g., `alignment-service`, `abundance-service`). The docs folder can house knowledge around your Golden Era vision and universal alignment practices.
